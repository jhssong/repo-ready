# Available Templates for repo-ready CLI

This document lists the GitHub repositories (and local files) from which you can fetch templates, Git hooks, and labels using the `repo-ready init` command. Each entry is identified by a unique `ID` for easy selection in the CLI.

---

## How to Use

When you run `repo-ready init`, you will be prompted to select which categories (Templates, Git Hooks, GitHub Labels) you want to set up. For each selected category, you will then be asked to choose an `ID` from the lists below.

## üè∑Ô∏è GitHub Labels

These sets provide predefined GitHub labels for your repository. Selecting a set will first **delete all existing labels** in your target repository before adding the new ones.

|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | **Repo-ready Labels** | Default labels for repo-ready | EN | `https://github.com/jhssong/repo-ready/labels` |

## Extending This List

You can extend this list by editing the `src/config/template-sources.json` file in your `repo-ready` CLI's installation directory. Just add new JSON objects to the respective `templates`, `hooks`, or `labels` arrays following the existing structure. After editing, remember to run `npm link` in the `repo-ready` project directory to update your global CLI.
