## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup (GitHub OAuth)

`repo-ready` requires GitHub OAuth App configuration to access the GitHub API.

1.  **Register a GitHub OAuth App**:
    - Log in to your GitHub account and navigate to [Developer settings](https://github.com/settings/developers).
    - Click the **OAuth Apps** tab and select **New OAuth App**.
    - Enter the following information:
      - **Application name**: `repo-ready-cli` (or a name of your choice)
      - **Homepage URL**: `https://github.com/jhssong/repo-ready`
      - **Authorization callback URL**: `http://localhost:3000/callback`
    - After registering the app, you will receive a **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

2.  **.env File Configuration**:
    - Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your `repo-ready` project.
    - Add your received `Client ID` and `Client Secret` as follows:

## üìù Usage

### 1. GitHub Login

If you're using `repo-ready` for the first time or your authentication token has expired, you'll need to log in to GitHub.

```bash
repo-ready login
```

Running this command will open your web browser and redirect you to the GitHub authentication page. Once you authorize, the CLI will automatically save your authentication token.

### 2. Initialize Project

`repo-ready` now fetches templates, Git Hooks, and GitHub Labels directly from remote repositories, ensuring you always have access to the latest versions or custom sets.

To see all available options and their sources, refer to the detailed list in [`src/config/AVAILABLE_TEMPLATES.md`](src/config/AVAILABLE_TEMPLATES.md) within the `repo-ready` project directory.

```bash
repo-ready init
```

This command will present interactive prompts allowing you to configure:

- **Template Selection**: Select which items you want to set up (Git Hooks, GitHub Templates, and/or GitHub Labels) by choosing an ID from the available remote options.
- **Git Hook Customization**: If `Git Hooks` are selected, you'll be guided through options like branch naming conventions (e.g., Jira-style).
- **GitHub Labels Configuration**: If `GitHub Labels` are selected, you'll provide the owner and repository name for which the labels should be created.
